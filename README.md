# Statistical-hypothesis-testing
Nihao! Welcome to this repo and thank you for your interest.


## About this repo
This repo aims to demonstrate how to clean up data, complete data imputation, and finally perform a t-test on two sets of survey data stored in different workbooks in an Excel file. The code here involves Pandas, Numpy, and Scipy which I would recommend social scientists to get familiar with!

## About the data
The data used here is authentic. It was first collected from over 170 respondents, entered, and organized manually. I wrote a journal paper based on the descriptive statistics from the data but the inferential statistics are never published due to the lack of statistical significance. (You may check out my paper here: https://repository.nie.edu.sg//handle/10497/22472) No, we don't always have statistical significance in social science. In the paper, I briefly explained why inferential statistics are not showcased. I also am intended to explain further from research and statistical respectives in my next commit of the repo. Stay tuned!


Keep well.
